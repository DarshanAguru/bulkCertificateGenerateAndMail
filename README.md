# Bulk-Certificate-Generate-And-Mail

The following program (or software) is a GUI based certificate generator and emailer. It can especially be used for 
sending Participation certificates for the event which can be a huge task if done manually.
This program will take a template of blank certtificate as an input and will enter the name of participants at the specified position
specified by user. Then it will save the certificates. It will then ask user about sending mail or not, If yes then it will ask for
the emails column in the provided excel sheet by user and then Email and Password of the sender*(org/club), then it will send emails to the participants.Thus making most of the process automated and hastle-free for users.


*Note:
    The sender has to enable "less secure app access" for the sender's email. It can be found at "security section" of "manage your google account" of the sender.


** Please make sure you have installed all the requirements mentioned in "requirements.txt" file. **
